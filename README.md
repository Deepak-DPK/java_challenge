# 30-Day Java Challenge

**A daily commitment to code, learn, and build consistency.**

⏱️ **Duration:** 30 consecutive days | **Started:** 27 January 2026 | **Status:** In Progress

---

## 🎯 The Goal

Write Java code every single day for 30 days straight. Build consistency, master fundamentals, and prove I can commit to something meaningful.

**Why?** Consistency beats intensity. Small, daily practice compounds into real mastery.

## 📚 What I'm Building

| Day | Topic | Files | Status |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Console Calculator | [calculator.java](DAY%201/calculator.java), [V2](DAY%201/CalculatorV2.java), [V3](DAY%201/CalculatorV3.java), [V4](DAY%201/CalculatorV4.java) | ✅ Done |
| 2-30 | Coming soon... | — | 🔄 In progress |

## 🛠️ My Process

1. **Decide** — Pick what to build today (practical, fun, or educational)
2. **Build** — Code the basic version (30-60 min focused work)
3. **Iterate** — Add validation, improve output, handle edge cases
4. **Reflect** — What did I learn? What's next?
5. **Push** — Commit code, update docs

## 💡 What I'm Practicing

- User input handling & validation
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Error handling & edge cases
- Clean, readable code
- Command-line programming

---

## ⚙️ Setup

- **Java:** OpenJDK 17+
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **Command:** `javac Program.java && java Program`

## 🚀 Quick Start

Pick a day and jump in:

```bash
cd "DAY 1"
javac calculator.java
java calculator
```

Each day has its own `README.md` with clear instructions.

## 📊 Progress

- **Day 1:** ✅ Console Calculator (4 versions)
- **Days 2-30:** 🔄 In progress...

## 🔑 Key Principle

Perfection is the enemy of progress. Some days will be messy. Some days will be elegant. Both are valuable. What matters is **showing up every single day**.
